Human Evaluation: <span style="color: #ff404091;">HELP</span></h1>

<h2>Aim:</h2>
<p>The purpose of the annotation schema is to compare the
    outputs from different models against each other.</p>

<p>Comparisons are performed in a pair-wise fashion and
will be ranked using an appropriate scoring algotirthm a
later stage. All examples are fully randomised.</p>

<h2>Task: Review Response Generation</h2>

<p>Each annotation example consists of a review text (above)
and two generated response texts (below, displayed
sibe-by-side).</p>

<p>The review title, if available, is displayed in bold and prefixed to the rest of the review body.</p>

<p>For each pair of response texts, we ask a single assessment
    question, e.g. 'which response is most related to the
    review?'. The assessment question is displayed at the top of
    the page.</p>

<h4>And the winner is...</h4>

<p>The user can drag the slider displayed below the
response texts to the left or right to indicate the degree
to which one response is better given the assessment question.</p>

<p>Moving the slider to the left means that the response on
the left is preferred. Conversely, moving the slider to the
right indicates that the response on the right is
prefered.</p>

<p>The amount the slider is moved indicates approximately <em>how much better</em>
the corresponding response is than the other response.</p>

<p>All the way to the left indicates that the response on the left is
entirely (e.g. 100%) better than the response on the right.
On the other hand, moving the slider only slightly to the
left (e.g. 15%) would indicate the the response on the left
is only slightly better than the response on the right.</p>

<h4>What to do if there's no clear winner</h4>

<p>In case of both response texts being <strong>suitable</strong>
given the assessment question, indicate a positive draw by
setting the slider in the middle (default value = 0) and
click the <span style="color:#4fd364;font-weight:bold">accept</span> button.</p>

<p>In case of both response texts being <strong>unsuitable</strong>
    given the assessment question (i.e. both responses are
    bad) indicate a negative draw by
    setting the slider in the middle (default value = 0) and
    click the <span style="color:#f74c4a;font-weight:bold">reject</span> button.</p>

<h2>Finalising an annotation</h2>
<p>Upon accepting or rejecting an annotation example, the
score provided will be saved and the next annotation task
will be displayed.</p>
