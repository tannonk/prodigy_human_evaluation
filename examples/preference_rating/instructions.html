<h1 style="color: #5e9ca0;">Conditional Text Generation
Human Evaluation: <span style="color: #ff404091;">HELP</span></h1>

<h2>Overview:</h2>
<p>The purpose of the annotation schema is to compare the
    outputs from different models against each other.</p>

<p>
    Comparisons are performed in a randomised pair-wise fashion.
    The results of the pair-wise scoring will be used to derive an overall ranking of all models being tested. For this we will use the TrueScore ranking algotirthm.
</p>

<h2>Task: Review Response Generation</h2>

<p>
    Each annotation example consists of a review text (above) and two generated response texts (below, displayed sibe-by-side).
</p>

<p>
    The review title, if available, is displayed in bold and prefixed to the rest of the review body.
</p>

<p>
    For each pair of response texts, we ask a single assessment question, e.g. 'which response is...?'. The assessment question is displayed below the review text.
</p>

<h3>And the winner is...</h4>

<p>
    The user can drag the slider displayed below the
response texts to the left or right to indicate the degree
to which one response is better given the assessment question.
</p>

<p>
    Moving the slider to the left means that the response on the left is preferred. Conversely, moving the slider to the right indicates that the response on the right is preferred.
</p>

<p>
    The amount the slider is moved indicates approximately <em>how much better</em> the corresponding response is than the other response.
</p>

<p>
    All the way to the left indicates that the response on the left is entirely (e.g. 100%) better than the response on the right. 
    On the other hand, moving the slider only slightly to the left (e.g. 15%) would indicate the the response on the left is only slightly better than the response on the right.
</p>

<h3>What to do if there's no clear winner</h4>

<p>
    If both response texts are <strong>suitable/acceptable</strong> given the assessment question, indicate a positive draw by setting the slider in the middle (default value = 0) and click the <span style="color:#4fd364;font-weight:bold">ACCEPT</span> button.
</p>

<p>
    If both response texts are <strong>unsuitable</strong> given the assessment question (i.e. both responses are highly unrelated) indicate a negative draw by setting the slider in the middle (default value = 0) and click the <span style="color:#f74c4a;font-weight:bold">REJECT</span> button.
</p>

<h2>Example 1</h2>

<p>
    <span style="color:#d1caff;font-weight:bold">REVIEW</span>:
    very good --- Very good hotel, with good service; the
    hotel rooms are very good. But the finish isn't perfect and
    could do with more attention. The staff were very friendly,
    welcoming and professional. The bar was everything you'd
    expect from Wetherspoons
</p>

<p>
    <span style="color:#b4e8fc;font-weight:bold">RESPONSE A</span>:
    Thank you for taking the time to leave us a review. We are
    pleased to hear you enjoyed your stay with us. We hope to
    welcome you back again soon.
</p>

<p>
    <span style="color:#9effd6;font-weight:bold">RESPONSE B</span>:
    Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your
    recent stay at Wetherspoons. I was pleased to read that you
    found the staff to be friendly, welcoming and professional
    and that the bar was everything you would expect from a
    hotel. I am sorry that the finish of the hotel was not to
    your liking and I will pass on your comments to the relevant
    departments. I hope that we will have the opportunity to
    welcome you back to the hotel in the near future. Kind
    regards, Michael Grange General Manager

<p>
    In this example, <span style="color:#b4e8fc;font-weight:bold">RESPONSE A</span> is freindly and appropriate
    given the tone of the review, however, it is also
    generic and fails to address any of the points
    raised in the review.
</p>

<p>
    In contrast, <span style="color:#9effd6;font-weight:bold">RESPONSE B</span> responds to specific points
    mentioned in the review, namely, the positive remark
    about the staff and the critique regarding the decor of
    the hotel. Therefore, <span style="color:#9effd6;font-weight:bold">RESPONSE B</span> is much more specific to the input
    review and should be indicated by setting the slider's
    cursor to the right (~100%) and hitting <span style="color:#4fd364;font-weight:bold">ACCEPT</span>.
</p>

<h2>Example 2</h2>

<p>
    <span style="color:#d1caff;font-weight:bold">REVIEW</span>:
    Amazing Hotel!! --- What a great hotel! My family & I
    just spend 4 days during Spring Break and had an amazing
    time. The rooms are beautifully renovated with a modern but
    cozy look. The rooms were very spacious and very clean.
    Having a kitchen in our room is very convinient when you
    have small children. The entire staff was so friendly and so
    welcoming. Great breakfast was included with lots of options
    for everyone. The location is perfectly located within the
    village. There is so much to do within the village and
    everything is a short walk away. This is definitely an
    annual family Spring Break getaway.
</p>

    <span style="color:#b4e8fc;font-weight:bold">RESPONSE A</span>:
    Thank you for taking the time to post a review of the
    Crystal Lodge following your recent visit to Whistler. I
    am pleased to read that you and your family enjoyed your
    stay with us. We look forward to welcoming you back
    again in the future. Warm regards, Ian Lowe

<p>
    <span style="color:#9effd6;font-weight:bold">RESPONSE B</span>:
    Thank you for taking the time to share your recent
    experience at the Crystal Lodge following your family's
    holiday. We are very pleased to read that you
    enjoyed your stay with us and we look forward to your
    next visit. Sincerely, Ian Lowe
</p>

<p>
    In this example, <span style="color:#b4e8fc;font-weight:bold">RESPONSE A</span> and <span style="color:#9effd6;font-weight:bold">RESPONSE B</span> are very similar and
    both are rather generic. They both pick up on the fact
    that the review is related to a family holiday but they
    fail to mention any of the main points raised in the
    review, e.g. 'Spring Break', quality of the rooms,
    breakfast and location, etc. Therefore, you could argue
    that the generated responses are not specific to the
    review and <span style="color:#f74c4a;font-weight:bold">REJECT</span> both, setting the slider's cursor in
    the middle.
</p>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

<p>
    A major challenge of Conditional Text Generation is
    hallucination, where the model generates content that is
    unsupported by the source. We are aware that our model
    outputs sometimes contain instances of hallucination and
    this will be investigated as part of future work. For
    the time being, feel free to ignore any obvious
    hallucination issues.
</p>

<h2>Finalising an annotation</h2>
