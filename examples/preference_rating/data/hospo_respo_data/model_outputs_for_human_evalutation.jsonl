Our room (41 ) overlooking the High Street and the beautiful Saint Mary The Virgin church was small-ish but very comfortable with a great bathroom. The service at The Old Bank is exceptional as is their wonderful restaurant, Quod. The Library Reading room was the perfect place for post-supper Sunday papers, drinks and catching up on e mails. The hotel Wi fi was excellent. I was delighted to find that the Real Tennis Court at Merton College, where I had a Sunday evening match, was only one minute away and whilst I played my wife enjoyed an ad lib Evensong at the nearby college Chapel. We then adjourned to the nearby Kings Arms pub for a pint in one of their back room snugs complete with open coal fire. Well worth the trip. I later found out that a good friend of ours had had a beer in that room during his Oxford Uni days with W H Auden! The hotel is central for everything and so our car stayed in the car park throughout our stay and the hotel very kindly allowed us an extra couple of hours parking whilst we completed our Oxford tour on the Monday lunchtime.

{"src_texts": "Haven away from Waikiki ---SEP--- After a few days in Waikiki Hilton Village we decided to split our short stay in Oahu with a trip out here for 3 days. Caught a fixed price Charleys taxi to the hotel . What a chilled resort! Loved it. Room was a studio with a king and sofa bed, was tiny and very dark but with 3 pools to choose from and the beach with comp sun beds I didn't care! There is an escape from the little kids in the hot tubs, the middle pool is called the reflection pool and the hot tub is kids free! Another tip is to buy food from the Island Store at Ko olina station ( Monkeypod kitchen and other restaurants here too), much cheaper than the resort which was $10.75 for a turkey sandwich and $8 hotdogs , the other store does salads and hot meals for takeaway corn dogs $1.70 chicken and rice $6. Ate at Longboards and Chucks, was pleasantly surprised at Chucks to have a great steak. The resort is full of good service and everyone is in on \"Aloha\" , felt like Hawaii as opposed to Waikiki.

{"src_texts": "Pleasant stay, but certainly not as good as previously ---SEP--- The last time I stayed in the Hudson Bay was about 10 years ago, soon after it opened. Was really impressed with it at the time. This occasion was a family wedding. I ate in the bar, at the wedding, and again at breakfast the next morning. The food was alright, but certainly nothing to write home about. But the hotel itself, I felt, had really gone down, there were some renovations going on - so once you got out of the lift, the place looked a bit dishevelled. And a lot of noise throughout the night from conversations from other visitors - management take note, if refurbishing, some better soundproofing would be in order. Also at breakfast the next morning, the doors and windows looked grubby. However, what saves this hotel is that the staff who were really attentive and pleasant - well done on that.", "ref_texts": "Thank you for your valued feedback on Trip Advisor.

{"src_texts": "A good deal ---SEP--- Was here for a two night stay that was a mixture of business and sightseeing. The rate per night was excellent, the rooms were typically solid Marriott rooms. Hotel contains a swimming pool, outside firepit and sitting area, ok workout facility for basic stuff, and plenty of parking. It is reasonably close to the airport, right by highway which gets you to downtown Charlotte within 7-8 minutes, so it was in an extremely convenient location. The staff, well I did not have to rely on them too much, but in my few dealings with them they seemed more interested in eating pizza, drinking coffee, or talking to their boyfriends. They do not seem like the most energetic bunch of workers nor did they possess particularly bubbly personalities, but still handled the few basic things in an acceptable manner. There is a bar and restaurant, but I did not eat there. I went to get a basic breakfast biscuit and the price for the sausage and egg biscuit by itself was 10 dollars-ridiculous. I understand that you pay more in retaurant hotels, but this was not even a sit down meal. There are enough other eating options in the area that are reasonably priced and probably better quality food so this was not a big deal for me. I would stay here again only if the rates were still reasonable. I definitely would not pay more than 120 per night for this hotel, but at that rate or less should be considered a bargain.", "ref_texts": "Thank you for posting your feedback about our property on Tripadvisor.

Joel Romero at the front desk exemplifies what I we expect from a Marriott hotel, great service and special treatment to Platinum members. Everything from check-in/out, special requests (local transportation, etc) always provided with a smile and a \"can do\" attitude. The remodel performed last couple of years of the rooms/facilities is very tasteful and elegant. This has become our favorite Marriott chain hotel in the UK!

{"src_texts": "Night before Thanksgiving, good with some disappointments ---SEP--- Beautiful hotel about 10-15 min walk to Amalie Center. Check in very quick, lady was very kind (sorry I didn’t catch name since it was loud in the lobby). Room clean but small. Booked the Pure Allergy room, was able to check in online and select on the executive lounge level 17th floor with double beds. Beds are pretty small, I kept rolling into my husband and we are both small people. Also, no HEPA filter in room but they did remove feather products. We use Clorox wipes whenever we arrive and the room was well dusted, so kudos to housekeeping. Received 2 comp appetizers with our room since none served in exec lounge which only had fruit, trail mix, juices, water, teas and coffees. Had to use downstairs at 211 where food was good (communication was a bit lacking since I called down to ask where apps would be served and I was told “in the lounge” so we waited a few minutes in the exec lounge but had to call again to find out it’s the lounge downstairs). However, server seemed a bit irritated and short although she still did a good job. Not sure if it was because we had the free apps but we did buy extra food for our kids and gave her a good tip. Anyway, exec lounge closed for Thanksgiving so no breakfast or snacks for us. Wish we would have known the night before since I would have stocked up on water, a couple of juices and some fruit. Also, no free breakfast with Honors Gold unlike Hilton Time Square and Beverly Hills. We use a noise maker when we sleep so sound was not an issue. But when I got up in the morning while family was still asleep I can hear noises next door and in the hallway. Overall decent, nice stay for a night after a hockey game.

Crazy lighting system all over the place took ages to find all the switches all I wanted was a reading light for the bed. Incessant beeping noise found out it was a dish washer. People next door sounded like they were in the same apartment as me poor sound proofing. Overcharged on leaving which is OK mistakes happen but the duty desk person definitely made me feel I had had the meal which as the waiter later confirmed was a large family. Was over charged on the mini bar. Again fairly common mistakes but in total the experience was sloppy and the reaction to my pointing out a mistake was judgemental and almost hostile, the tut and rolled up eyes didnt go down well.

{"src_texts": "Only if you don't have any other choice ---SEP--- This was a last minute booking for us by someone else, and we would have done better to pay more attention to other reviews before confirming. First things first, if you want to be near the beach at Manly this place is well located as it's only one street back (but see my comment below about the road). Now for the rest: it's apparently managed by the Backpacker Hostel round the corner, and the backpacker mentality is apparent in the way it's managed and fitted out. On arrival you have to leave a $30 deposit for the keys, fair enough, but instead of taking an imprint of your credit card and then cancelling it (like 99% of other places do) they actually deduct the money and then refund it afterwards. If you're from overseas this means you pay two bank transactions, each with fees. When we pointed this out we were told \"I don't know the difference [between cancelling and refunding]\". Well I'm afraid in this line of work you should know the difference! There are then about 35 steps to get to the apartments (no lift), which can be difficult with heavy/voluminous luggage. The kitchen is decorated with signs telling you you'll have to pay a $2000 fire brigade call out fee if you burn the toast (see what I mean about backpacker mentality?). The room we were in faced out onto the main road, as there is no double glazing or sound insulation of any sort it was very noisy, especially in the morning. The bathroom door was on a noisy sliding runner, impossible to go to the toilet in the middle of the night without waking your partner. Wifi was not free (seriously in this day and age?); it was the only place we stayed in during a month's travels in Australia where we would have had to pay, however at the backpacker hostel round the corner they at least had 30 minutes free (according to the sign plastered on the front of that building). If you're looking for accommodation that's only one step up from a hostel this is for you, otherwise avoid.", "ref_texts": "Hey there, Thank you for your review. As a budget hotel our aim is to provide clean, comfortable accommodation at the best price in Manly. We do charge a key deposit as provide guests with a physical key not a swipe card, the deposit reminded people to return the key at the end of the stay. However, I can understand your frustration with international bank charges and will look into the alternative of holding the charge on the card. We do also accept cash, which obviously would not have incurred any extra charges for you. Manly Beachside Apartments and Manly Backpackers are owned by the same company, we do have a reception at the Beachside Apartments which is open from 2pm - 5pm Monday to Saturday, if you check in outside of these times we do ask guests to check in at the hostel, which is just across the road, this is the only point where the two business cross paths as they are run independetly of each other. All of the rooms are on the first floor and accessed by the main staircase, if you do have lots of bags our staff are always happy to help in any way they can.

The bed was very comfortable and we had a very good sleep, despite the light coming in from the path outside and the conversations we could hear through the wall. The only major down side was the shower, which was either scalding hot or freezing cold. When asked about this, the receptionist didn't offer much assistance, though we were told on departure that a plumber was coming to look at the issue.

Never had this experience and it was nice. Check in was efficient and warm, with an interest in how my day/journey had been. The less than 5 star rating is more to do with poor attention when it came to the room we had booked for interviews the following day and the issue of parking. Firstly, we struggled to get the simple issue of a jug of water replenished, secondly a member of staff walked in right in the middle of an interview (!) and finally our validated ticket (to give us free parking in the nearby NCP in the absence of an hotel car park) had not been validated and we had to pay £15 to get out because we were in a hurry.

{"src_texts": "Don't believe the hype! ---SEP--- Spent 5 nights here, on a 15k Points and 400 AUD Cash rate, booked before Hyatt changed the P&C system. If I had paid anything more than this, I would have checked out early... My review will be based on the fact that this hotel has a standard rate upwards of $850 per night. Which, to me, is incomprehensible... We arrived very early (7:30am) and of course, as expected, there was no room available, as the hotel was fully booked. After a nearly 24 hours of traveling, we wanted to refresh, so we were told that we could use the gym facilities to do so. The gym facilities are very small. 3 people barely fit in the room. There were no lockers to store anything while showering (they were all locked). Only one shower, with a small, used bottle of shampoo and no soap in it. We joked about this with a gentleman from Alabama while he waited for me to shower. \"I'll save you some shampoo\", I told him. Then we decided we wanted some breakfast. As a Globalist, breakfast is free, but not on the day of your arrival, we were told, so 65 AUD for breakfast. The breakfast spread was nice, but nothing to write home about, or pay for. We had breakfast on 2 of the 5 days we were there after that. Given that no room upgrade was available, maybe a nice customer service gesture would have been to treat us to breakfast on this first day? No... At around 11am we received a call that the room was ready, so we headed back to the hotel. Location wise, the hotel does not win any points. It's nice if you want to explore the Rocks area, but for the rest of the city it's a long walk to the nearest train or bus station - at least 15 minutes. Which brings me to the view... Yes, if you have a room with an Opera view, the view is nice. We did not get any Globalist upgrade, as the hotel was full, so we stayed in the booked Harbor View King. Room 128, on the first floor. The first impression of the room itself was nice, but nothing to write home about. Our view was of each and every cruise ship that docked in the harbor, and a bit of the city in the background. If I stepped out onto the balcony, and leaned over the edge, and looked left, yes, there was the Opera. But really? You can stay at the Four Seasons or the Shangri-La for half of the PH standard rate for a non-view room, and get their harbor view room, and have the entire harbor and Opera in your view... The best thing about the room was the Le Labo cosmetics. The bathroom was nice, but the shower pressure mediocre. And the TV in the room was placed too low across from the bed, it was difficult to watch without getting a neck ache. The room was clean, apart from a long black hair I noticed in the shower on our third day (neither of us has long black hair...). And the noise... Upon arrival, we felt like napping. I had to use the earplugs I got from the plane to get some sleep! The noise from the harbor, trucks backing up close by, and people shouting outside the hotel on the promenade, was too much. When we returned to the hotel on our first evening, at around 11:45pm, I requested a new pair of earplugs from the front office. I was told they were going to send it up to the room. 30 minutes later I got dressed again, walked back to the front desk, asked again, and this time I waited there until they brought them to me. Overall, I was not impressed by the service. All smiles, but... If I had booked a standard rate, I would have probably checked out after the second night, and relocated elsewhere. I am a very frequent traveler, Globalist with WoH, and I do stay at luxury hotels. The value for money that the Park Hyatt in Sydney provides is nowhere close to being good. I would not return.

{"src_texts": "Avoid this hotel even if free ---SEP--- Travel is my business. I can allow for many things that may go wrong during a hotel stay but I could never allow for a consistantly bad customer service. Our flight was delayed. We arrived to the hotel 24 hours later than usual due to a big snow storm that closed many airports .....Needless to say we could not wait to get into a warm shower and comfortable bed. We were told by a cold front desk employee that we have no reservations. We showed them the travel agents reservations and their response sorry your reservations were for last night and if you do not show up they are cancelled entirely. We were surprised and said we were booked for five days and we missed one day but we still have 4 more reserved and already paid for in advance. Sorry nothing we can do says the young cold girl at the front sesk. She offered no suggestions. I said what can we do.? Her answer we have the space book the rooms again. it was for almost 200 dollars a night. was willing to accept but I thought maybe the front desk manager would have some helpful ideas. Big mistake to have bothered the front desk manager. He was upset that we even bothered him offered nothing but cold and non helpfel comments. I feel that he cares about his hair and glasses a lot more than he cares about business. we ended up staying the night and we would never go back even if free. All the staff that we had encountered at the front desk were cold and impersonal. They looked to me like they were reading from a script. The rooms were ok but nothing special. The view was horrible and the windows were dirty and we found old socks in the corner of the room. I would have never got mad about the socks if the front desck staff had any warmth or hospitality training in them. I feel the problem is an attitude problem that stems from the top. Do yourselves a favour and get rid of the front desk staff from top to bottom. even the staff on day shift when we checked out were made with the same ingredients as those ones from the night before. How sad you can have a nice property if you teach the staff the value of ncustomer service. The rest of the staff in the bar and dining broom as well as the valet were more friendly but far from fine.

I was working at a conference taking place at the adjoining Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre. The hotel is ideally located for any event at the Convention Centre and it was great to be able to easily return to my room - as well as other hotel facilities - at any time during the conference. I arranged my stay via email earlier this year and, on my arrival, check-in was fast, I was given an upgrade for my week there, and was personally welcomed by the duty manager. And it was very easy to see that some things just don't change at this hotel - you always get fantastic service with a smile from all staff, top quality food, and the rooms and facilities are always looking first-class. Nothing is ever too much trouble. The person who oversees the Executive Lounge, who has been there since this quite new hotel opened and we have seen there every time we have stayed at this hotel, does a superb job - as do all the staff there. When you are away from home for a week, to be personally welcomed back is a great way to start your stay. The service and food in the Executive Lounge are always excellent. I often spent hours working in the Lounge as it is such a great, very spacious facility.

{"src_texts": "Good for the price ---SEP--- My wife and I stayed at the Magnolia hotel for a one-night anniversary get-away. I chose the hotel primarily because of the price and a recommendation of a family member. We paid $202, which included tax, a $26 valet parking fee, and a $5 bottle of Voss water that we accidentally opened while in our room. Here's what I liked about the hotel: - Central location. - Convenient, reasonably-priced valet parking. - Free afternoon cocktails. - Price. Honestly, if you include the cost of valet parking, this is about as cheap at it gets for a decent hotel in this part of the city. I wasn't crazy about the room itself, though. We were on the 11th floor in a standard King room. It felt a tiny bit cramped. More importantly, it just didn't seem very pleasant. There was something missing in the quality of the decor. The bed was adequately comfortable after a night of dancing, but not overly so. For about $60 more per night, you can go to the hotel next door for a serious upgrade in room quality. The Magnolia presents itself as a boutique hotel, but I think it's in need of a little extra TLC to be truly deserving of the \"boutique\" designation. If you're looking to lounge around in luxury all day, I'd recommend going elsewhere. That said, if you just want a decent place to stay downtown without breaking the bank, the Magnolia should suit you. Side note: there were two weddings going on. It does seem like a nice place to hold a wedding, as it has a lovely reception area on the lower level, and the overall feel on this and the main floor is one of elegance.", "ref_texts": "Thank you for staying with us and thank you for such a comprehensive review!
