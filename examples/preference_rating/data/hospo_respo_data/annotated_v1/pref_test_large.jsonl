{"src_text":"Haven away from Waikiki ---SEP--- After a few days in Waikiki Hilton Village we decided to split our short stay in Oahu with a trip out here for 3 days.

{"src_text":"Such a shame... ---SEP--- Having always wanted to stay at The Balmoral we resulted in having a great excuse when friends invited us to their wedding here. We booked a standard room and greatly looked forward to our special treat. We booked into the room and our initial thoughts were sadly a tired room. It was clean but clearly well worn. We had a fabulous time at the wedding and fell into bed exhausted. Bed and linen fantastic. When we showered, brushed our teeth and hubby shaved we had dirty water in both sink and bath which you had to stand in collecting as it wouldn't drain away. When we had breakfast which was good and checked out my hubby mentioned this but the happy couple appeared so we took it no further. I then wrote to The Balmoral, who promptly responded apologising, explaining they are upgrading rooms and offered us an upgrade the next time we stay. Having no reason to stay as we live locally that's unlikely to happen.

Upon arrival my wife and I were assigned to a second floor room in the courtyard. Due to her childhood polio, this proved challenging and the reservation manager immediately and without specific request shifted us to a room on the main level closer to the main rooms. After dinner, he noticed that she was tired and immediately volunteered to drive us with his personal car to our room, thus avoiding the interior staircase in the main building. We simply won't forget his kindness, and this level of caring was evident in other staff members. Simply, you can have a great property, but it can never be as meaningful if it does not have extraordinary people dedicated to the highest level of service. This is truly a special place to visit.","_input_hash":-1618554447,"_task_hash":-700149326,"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"blocks","answer":"accept"}

{"src_text":"A good deal ---SEP--- Was here for a two night stay that was a mixture of business and sightseeing. The rate per night was excellent, the rooms were typically solid Marriott rooms. Hotel contains a swimming pool, outside firepit and sitting area, ok workout facility for basic stuff, and plenty of parking. It is reasonably close to the airport, right by highway which gets you to downtown Charlotte within 7-8 minutes, so it was in an extremely convenient location. The staff, well I did not have to rely on them too much, but in my few dealings with them they seemed more interested in eating pizza, drinking coffee, or talking to their boyfriends. They do not seem like the most energetic bunch of workers nor did they possess particularly bubbly personalities, but still handled the few basic things in an acceptable manner. There is a bar and restaurant, but I did not eat there. I went to get a basic breakfast biscuit and the price for the sausage and egg biscuit by itself was 10 dollars-ridiculous. I understand that you pay more in retaurant hotels, but this was not even a sit down meal. There are enough other eating options in the area that are reasonably priced and probably better quality food so this was not a big deal for me.

{"src_text":"Night before Thanksgiving, good with some disappointments ---SEP--- Beautiful hotel about 10-15 min walk to Amalie Center. Check in very quick, lady was very kind (sorry I didn\u2019t catch name since it was loud in the lobby). Room clean but small. Booked the Pure Allergy room, was able to check in online and select on the executive lounge level 17th floor with double beds. Beds are pretty small, I kept rolling into my husband and we are both small people. Also, no HEPA filter in room but they did remove feather products. We use Clorox wipes whenever we arrive and the room was well dusted, so kudos to housekeeping. Received 2 comp appetizers with our room since none served in exec lounge which only had fruit, trail mix, juices, water, teas and coffees. Had to use downstairs at 211 where food was good (communication was a bit lacking since I called down to ask where apps would be served and I was told \u201cin the lounge\u201d so we waited a few minutes in the exec lounge but had to call again to find out it\u2019s the lounge downstairs). However, server seemed a bit irritated and short although she still did a good job. Not sure if it was because we had the free apps but we did buy extra food for our kids and gave her a good tip. Anyway, exec lounge closed for Thanksgiving so no breakfast or snacks for us. Wish we would have known the night before since I would have stocked up on water, a couple of juices and some fruit. Also, no free breakfast with Honors Gold unlike Hilton Time Square and Beverly Hills. We use a noise maker when we sleep so sound was not an issue. But when I got up in the morning while family was still asleep I can hear noises next door and in the hallway. Overall decent, nice stay for a night after a hockey game. Next time will try MARRIOTT or Embassy Suites which is right next door to Amalie Arena and breakfast will be for sure.","id":18405,"ref_text":"Dear MamaB5, Thank you for taking the time to share your most recent experience with us.
