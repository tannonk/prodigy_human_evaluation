{"text": "A Real 5-Star Hotel ---SEP--- Upon arrival, we were welcomed back, even though we'd only enjoyed their wonderful high tea last July. We were escorted to our beautiful room--a room so beautiful that we felt like it was a vacation in itself. We arrived with rather bad jetlag so we immediately crawled into bed. We were never disturbed with outside noise or any noise from the hallway. Our room was quiet, very quiet, our entire stay. The bathroom was also magnificent and HUGE; including a “rain” shower, a bathtub big enough for two, a heated floor, and separate sinks. The hotel appeared to have painstakingly pursued every detail imaginable. But, with all the attention to detail, the staff was as warm and friendly as any we've ever encountered. We spoiled ourselves with incredible in-room dining (three times, I believe). The location was also perfect for our exploration of London (for instance, walking distance to Her Majesty's Theatre). I can't imagine a better location, actually. OK...I've reached the conclusion this might indeed be the finest hotel that we've experienced in all our travels! (Oh, and don't miss high tea during your stay!)", "options": [ {"id": "/srv/scratch6/kew/bart/hospo_respo/en/500k/baseline/inference/bs5.txt", "text": "Dear guest, Thank you for taking the time to share your kind review following your visit to the Montague.
