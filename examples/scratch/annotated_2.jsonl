{"src_text":"A Real 5-Star Hotel ---SEP--- Upon arrival, we were welcomed back, even though we'd only enjoyed their wonderful high tea last July. We were escorted to our beautiful room--a room so beautiful that we felt like it was a vacation in itself. We arrived with rather bad jetlag so we immediately crawled into bed. We were never disturbed with outside noise or any noise from the hallway. Our room was quiet, very quiet, our entire stay. The bathroom was also magnificent and HUGE; including a \u201crain\u201d shower, a bathtub big enough for two, a heated floor, and separate sinks. The hotel appeared to have painstakingly pursued every detail imaginable. But, with all the attention to detail, the staff was as warm and friendly as any we've ever encountered. We spoiled ourselves with incredible in-room dining (three times, I believe). The location was also perfect for our exploration of London (for instance, walking distance to Her Majesty's Theatre). I can't imagine a better location, actually. OK...I've reached the conclusion this might indeed be the finest hotel that we've experienced in all our travels! (Oh, and don't miss high tea during your stay!)","id":15764,"ref_text":"I greatly enjoyed reading your glowing review of Corinthia London. To be considered the finest hotel you\u2019ve experienced on all your travels is certainly a great compliment. Thank you. It is pleasing to know you enjoyed our spacious and luxurious rooms and bathrooms as they were designed with these key qualities in mind and attention to detail is certainly at the core of all we offer. I am also happy to hear that our team were the warmest you have encountered, I am delighted to see their dedication and personalities are shining through. The hotel does indeed benefit from a fantastic location as it is in walking distance to Covent Garden, London\u2019s Theatre scene, the Southbank, Westminster, Waterloo, Soho, to name a few.

{"src_text":"Amazing Hotel!! ---SEP--- What a great hotel! My family & I just spend 4 days during Spring Break and had an amazing time. The rooms are beautifully renovated with a modern but cozy look. The rooms were very spacious and very clean. Having a kitchen in our room is very convinient when you have small children. The entire staff was so friendly and so welcoming. Great breakfast was included with lots of options for everyone. The location is perfectly located within the village. There is so much to do within the village and everything is a short walk away. This is definitely an annual family Spring Break getaway.","id":7577,"ref_text":"Dear Sandra Thank you for sharing your comments with us regarding your stay.

{"src_text":"Business Trip ---SEP--- Was here for an over night at a conference. It has great parking facilities. Easy check in and no nonsense like other hotels. Rooms fresh and clean (not oversized but grand!) Beds very comfortable and black out blinds. Great sleep. Breakfast okay not alot on offer but adequate. As part of our conference we were served quiet a poor lunch and wouldn't be fooled into buying it again. There is a lovely little cafe around the corner which did lovely lunch. Supervalu also round the corner. Hotel is good and the staff are well trained. Had dinner on one evening and it was lovely. would recommend that.
